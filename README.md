# CRUD Web Application using JEE

## Introduction

This CRUD web application is designed to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a database using Java Enterprise Edition (JEE). It incorporates several concepts and technologies, including the DAO (Data Access Object) Design Pattern and Singleton pattern, as well as the following technologies:

- Servlet: Used to handle server-side interactions.
- JDBC: Utilized for database interactions.
- Session-based Authentication: To secure access to the application.
- JSP (JavaServer Pages): Employed to generate dynamic web pages.
- JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library): Used for simplifying JSP page creation.
- Bootstrap: Utilized to enhance layout and UI styling.

## Project Architecture

The application follows a robust architecture based on the principles of the DAO Design Pattern and Singleton pattern. Here's an overview of the project structure:

- **DAO (Data Access Object)**: This pattern is used to separate data access logic from the application's business logic. Each entity in the database (e.g., a table) has its own DAO to handle CRUD operations.

- **Singleton**: The Singleton pattern is employed to ensure that only one instance of each DAO is created and shared throughout the application. This ensures efficient and consistent data management.

- **Servlets**: Servlets are used to handle HTTP requests and interact with DAOs to perform CRUD operations.

- **JSP and JSTL**: JSP pages are used to display dynamically generated content produced by the application. JSTL is used to simplify the creation of these JSP pages.

- **Bootstrap**: The Bootstrap library is used to enhance layout and the user interface's appearance.

## Application Features

The application offers the following features:

- Authentication: Users must authenticate using sessions to access the application.

- CRUD Operations: Authorized users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database data.

- User-Friendly UI: The application features a user-friendly interface created with Bootstrap for an improved user experience.

## Conclusion

This CRUD web application, developed using JEE, serves as an example of implementing robust design principles and key technologies for creating interactive and secure web applications. You can further customize this application to meet your specific requirements and use it as a foundation for other JEE projects. Happy coding!
